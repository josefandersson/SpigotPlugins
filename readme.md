#### CraftBukkit/Bukkit/Spigot plugins developed by Josef Andersson (AKA DrDoof).
These plugins where created on my free time and cost me a lot of time to develop. Please do not steal my work. Feel free to use the code, or snippets of my code, but give credit where credit's due. Thanks.

Many of these plugins require [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) to work. Apart from a PostgreSQL server to connect to they also need the [PostgreSQL plugin](/tree/master/PostgreSQL) to be installed alongside their own. 

## SeedPlanter
Makes it faster to replant seeds in farms. Useful on servers where farming is a big and important part of the economy. 

## TownyChunkLoader
Don't miss out on plant growth just because you go offline. This plugin allows players to select 1 or multiple chunks as "chunk loaders" which let's crops, cacti, sugar cane and sapling grow even when the chunks are unloaded. *(Contradictory to the name, this plugin doesn't actually keep chunks loaded, but rather simulates Minecraft's random ticks whenever a "chunk loader" chunk is loaded. Thus, in effect the end-result is very similar except for auto-farmers not working as efficiently, or at all.)*
